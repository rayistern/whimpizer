## üìû Questions for You

1. **Stripe Priority**: Start with simple monthly subscriptions or complex credit system?

2. **Content Strategy**: Should we build a blog/content marketing early?

3. **Target Market**: Focus on parents, teachers, or kids directly?

4. **Feature Scope**: Add more story styles now or focus on growth first?

5. **Pricing Strategy**: Start high and discount, or start low and raise prices?

**My Recommendation**: Start with simple Stripe subscriptions, basic landing page, then grow from there. Keep it simple but professional!
