# Postprocessing Empty Lines Analysis

## Issue Summary
When deleting text in postprocessing, entire lines (like h3 lines) were leaving blank spaces in their place instead of being completely removed.

## Root Cause
There were **two different mechanisms** for handling unwanted lines in the codebase:

### 1. 'skip' Elements (Correct Approach)
- Used for non-weekday h2 lines
- **Completely filtered out** during preprocessing:
  ```python
  # Filter out 'skip' elements  
  parsed_content = [item for item in parsed_content if item[0] != 'skip']
  ```
- Result: No empty lines left behind

### 2. 'h1' and 'h3' Elements (Problematic Approach) 
- **Only skipped during rendering**:
  ```python
  # Skip h1 and h3 entirely (Wimpy Kid books have no visible headers)
  if element_type in ['h1', 'h3']:
      continue
  ```
- Problem: Elements remained in `parsed_content` list, potentially causing spacing issues

## Solution Implemented
1. **Unified the filtering approach** by filtering out h1 and h3 elements at the same stage as 'skip' elements:
   ```python
   # Filter out 'skip', 'h1', and 'h3' elements
   parsed_content = [item for item in parsed_content if item[0] not in ['skip', 'h1', 'h3']]
   ```

2. **Removed redundant rendering check** since h1 and h3 elements are now filtered out during preprocessing

## Files Modified
- `wimpy_pdf_generator.py` (lines 535-536 and 700-702)

## Result
Text deletion in postprocessing now consistently removes entire lines without leaving empty spaces behind.
