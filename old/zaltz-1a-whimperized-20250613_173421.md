Here’s a quick breakdown:

1. Wimpy-Kid Style: 9/10  
   • You’ve nailed the hallmarks—diary dates, unfairness rankings, CAPS, self-centered perspective, absurd schemes, physical mishaps and kid-logic tangents.  
   • To hit a perfect 10, you could sprinkle in one or two more totally random sidebars (e.g., a chart of his “Hiding Skill Levels,” a mock “Hide-and-Seek Hall of Fame”) or a few off-topic complaints about his little brother’s latest prank.  

2. Story Fidelity: 10/10  
   • Every plot point and historical detail from the source is there—hiding during school hours, the 2-3-2 knock code, sister in public school, Melamed’s whisper, fleeing Kharkov, refusing non-kosher food, near-misses with teachers and guards, families sent away, the tunnel idea, etc.  
   • Nothing has been invented or changed in substance—just dramatized, reframed, and filtered through Hillel’s eight-year-old lens.

In short, this version is highly authentic to both Jeff Kinney’s “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” voice and the original Samarkand narrative. Great job striking that balance!
