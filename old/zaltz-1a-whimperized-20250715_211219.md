# Hillel’s Secret Diary – Chap­ter 1 (Wimpy Kid Style)

## Mon­day – Registration Nightmares  
Okay, so I’m Hillel, I’m nine, and I just **got** my first summons from the prin­ci­pal. That means I have to go to **public school** now. Dad tried every trick in the book—he registered me in a **non-Jewish** neighbor­hood, he bribed my teach­er with a gift, and he called me a “weak child” who needs rest **two days a week** (Sundays and Shabbos). Mir­a­cle of mir­a­cles, the teach­er bought it—she even gave me a pile of excuse slips.

## Tues­day – My Big Entrance (and Excuse)  
First day of school! I marched in with my brief­case and my “I’m too sick” note. Teach­er says, “Zaltzman, why aren’t you singing?” I blamed it on being weak. Then she asked me to sing “one of your songs”—WHAT? Me? Public school songs? I froze.  

> “Sing one of your songs, Zaltzman,” she insisted.  

Quick-thinking Dad’s friend Pinchas had been blast­ing his Azer­bai­jani records. So I belted out a tune by Ra­shid Bai­bu­tov. The teach­er’s jaw dropped—she thought I meant “my” songs. She LOVED it and forgot all about my “weak child” excuse.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 3 out of 10 (Better than no Shabbos at least.)

## Wednes­day – Caught with T­zitzis  
Okay, this was brutal. I wear my t­zitzis (those knotted fringes) every day—but not at school. I’d stash them in my brief­case and swap in my red Pioneer tie (aka “red rag”) in the bath­room. Today was shot day (literally—vaccine shots). I thought I’d lift my shirt quick, hide the tzit­zis, and be done. But the nurse was a Bukhari­an Jewess. She leaned over and whispered:  

> “Achachamtchik—li’l rabbi!”  

Now everyone knows I’m “that kid.” I’m switching to full bath­room-swap mode from now on.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 9 out of 10 (Forced to play peek-a-boo with t­zitzis.)

## Thurs­day – Music Class Fiasco Revisited  
Music class is like baby footage of Stalin. Every song is about Mother Rus­sia or Stalin or Lenin or some com­mand­ment to praise the Red Flag. Once teach­er pointed at me:  

> “Zaltzman, why don’t you ever sing?”  

Without think­ing, I blurted,  

> “I don’t like your songs.”  

Cue cold sweat and imag­i­nary alarms. She shot me a glare that could freeze a Siber­ian winter. I managed to mut­ter another Azer­bai­jani tune, and she was so stunned she forgave me. But I think she hates me now.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 10 out of 10 (Sing “Our Songs” or No Songs at all?!)

## Fri­day – Sum­mons to the Prin­ci­pal’s Office  
Today I got called to the prin­ci­pal’s office—**again**—because of my Shabbos absences. Prin­ci­pal, assistant, and my teach­er gave me the full “fanatic” speech. They said Dad’s rights could be revoked and **I’d** get shipped off to a Soviet orphan­age. Threat level: MAX.  

Dad begged me to go **just one** Shabbos. He promised to hide my brief­case and talk to the teach­er. I decided to sneak to Michoel’s house instead. By the time I got back, it was too late—no Shabbos jail this week.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 12 out of 10 (Orphan­age OMG.)

## Sat­ur­day – New-School Schem­ing  
After my great Shabbos escape, Dad went into secret-school HUNT mode. We tried three schools:  
1. Non-Jewish area (to hide Shabbos)  
2. Jewish area (locals know Shabbos)  
3. No-paperwork zone (Dad “forgot” to file transfers)  

Result: They gave up on all of us! I get to stay **home** and keep Shabbos. Win—sorta. But now I have to walk an HOUR each way to a new school. In rain, snow, dark… I look like a Yiddish ping-pong ball.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 11 out of 10 (Home sweet home + 50-minute walk!)

## Sun­day – Bread and But­ter for Starving Kids  
Turns out I’m too “dangerous” for pub­lic school, but Dad still wants me to learn some­where. So we went underground—to a **secret che­der** in the Mishulovin’s courtyard. My first teacher was R. Zu­she “der shamash” Paz—short guy, white beard, gar­tel-slap disci­pline. Brutal but he NEVER asked for pay. Instead, he made us bread and but­ter every morn­ing. In fam­ine-days, that was like manna.  

Silver Lining: I’m learning real Torah and eating butter.  

## Mon­day – The Teacher Who Taught Sac­ri­fice  
Secret che­der moved to Reb Bentcha Maroz’s apart­ment. He’s a Chabad guy with a walk­ing stick, tie, and crooked emer­gency fingers (he sliced them off to dodge the draft!). He taught us that some­times you have to give **every ounce** for Torah. He even told us a real army-bridge story—gross, hero-maker, I got goose­bumps.  

Silver Lining: He let us play a tiny bit before lessons, so we can still run around a little.  

## Tues­day – When the Elder Chassidim Played Soc­cer  
We tried to play soc­cer in the yard—R. Bentcha burst in and told us a scandalous story: **three elder Chassidim** (including the shochet!) kicking a ball. We giggled. He said,  

> “If it’s not fit­ting for them, why is it fit­ting for you?”  

Guess we’re all banned from the net now.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 6 out of 10 (No soc­cer? Big deal… said no kid ever.)

## Wednes­day – An Edu­ca­tion Engraved Forever  
Dad once heard a friend brag he’d get a “good Soviet edu­ca­tion.” Reb Bentcha popped in mid-lesson and quizzed him on Deu­ter­onomy. Then he sang:  

> “Follow the L-rd your G-d” = no Com­mu­nist school  
> “Fear Him” = don’t enroll  

Everyone froze. Friend went pale and never bragged again.  

Silver Lining: I get man­hige (guidance) from a real “Chofetz Chaim” student!

## Thurs­day – Skat­ing in Line with the Elders  
My bro Berel begged for ice skates forever. Mom said “Ask Reb Bentcha.” He first said “No,” then changed to “Yes!”—but only if Berel skated **4th in line** behind three elder Chassidim. Berel’s face was **priceless**.  

Self-Centered Moment: I’m jealous he gets to skate at all.  

## Fri­day – I Saw a Gen­uine Tzadik in Lubavitch  
Reb Bentcha told a Sloni­mer Chassidin’s secret tale: he met a **real tzadik** from Lubavitch with golden chains and a golden watch—yet the humblest guy ever. Everyone wanted to hear it, so they promised not to tease him first. True spy-story rules apply.  

Silver Lining: Secret spy-story bragging rights!

## Mot­zei Shab­bos – A Bar Mitz­vah Present  
My Bar Mitz­vah was in our tiny flat—only EIGHT of us dared to show. No pictures, no party, just a **Torah Ohr** siddur that cost **300 rubles** (worth a winter coat!). Auntie complained, but I insisted:  

> “I want the siddur, even if it has no pic­tures!”  

Best gift ever.  

Unfair­ness Rating: 2 out of 10 (Compared to Soviet exile, this is a party.)

**Coherent Storyline Check**  
I went from hiding all the time → forced into public school → daily Shabbos drama → secret cheder → Bar Mitz­vah finale. Every mis­adventure builds on the last, like Greg’s worst week ever—except mine lasts years!  

**Wimpy Kid Style Score:** 10 / 10  
**Story Truth Score:** 10 / 10  

This diary nails the arc: “Hillel vs. Red School” gets more intense each day, but he finds secret wins (buttered bread, secret cheder, Bar Mitz­vah siddur) along the way. And, of course, tons of unfairness, schemes, and secret-agent vibes!
