## My Secret Cheder Challenge

### The Big Goal: Stay a Chassidishe Kid While Hiding from Communist School

---

#### Monday

Unfairness ranking: 10 out of 10

Today Tatty told me the news: it's time for Operation Stay Out of Communist School. The plan? Hide at home and secretly learn Torah. If the neighbors or the “three letters” police find out, BOOM—game over. I’m pretty sure regular kids don’t have to play hide-and-seek for their entire lives. Also, nobody asked me if I wanted to be the family’s secret project.

I’m not allowed to go outside. Not even to throw out the garbage. I tried making a “secret agent mask” out of a sock, but Mommy said, “That’s not how we keep a low profile, Hillel.”

#### Tuesday

Tatty and Mommy have a whole code for when someone comes to the door. Two knocks, a pause, three knocks, a pause, then two more. If you do it wrong, you get the “panic stare” from Mommy. I practiced it on my pillow just in case I need to go undercover.

Yankel says if you mess up, you go straight to Siberia. I think he’s kidding, but with him, you never know.

I tried inventing a “Hillel’s Hideaway” fort behind the sofa, just in case. It fell on my foot. Unfairness upgrade: 12 out of 10.

#### Wednesday

Tatty says the “three letters” police are everywhere. I asked which three letters: Alef, Beis, Gimmel? He said, “No, the Russian kind.” Why can’t the police have nice names, like “The Good Job Squad”?

Today I got bored and tried to teach myself soccer moves in the hallway. Broke Mommy’s vase. On the plus side, I’m the world champion of “Quietest Soccer Dribble.” Downside: grounded from imaginary soccer for a week.

#### Thursday

Tatty says some parents send their kids to the Communist school, but not us. I asked, “Will I ever get to go to regular school?” Tatty looked like he swallowed a lemon.

Yankel says if you go to that school, you have to sing about Stalin and eat bread on Pesach. I said, “Maybe I could just HUM the songs?” Yankel says that’s how they get you.

I made a list of ways to stay hidden:

1. Only breathe during loud street noise
2. Never sneeze near the window
3. Practice hiding under the bed (got stuck. Needed rescue)

#### Friday

Shabbos prep is like a spy movie. Mommy says, “Quick! Hide the chumash!” every time someone walks by. I invented “The Chumash Toss”—see how fast you can get all the seforim under the couch when you hear footsteps. High score: 11 seconds.

Rivka says I’m making a mess. She’s just jealous I’m better at hiding.

#### Sunday

Mr. Daniel came over. He used the code knock. He told us about how the Communists once tried to make all the teachers “secretly not Jewish.” I think that means they’re like undercover anti-candy agents, but for Torah.

He looked sad. Adults are always sad when they talk about the old days. I tried to cheer him up by offering him a jelly candy. He didn’t smile, but he took two. Win for me.

---

#### Monday

Tatty says if the principal finds out I exist, I’ll get sent to a “re-education home.” I asked if that’s like camp. Tatty said, “It’s camp but with no fun, no Torah, and no coming home.”

I drew a map of all the possible escape routes from the house. Rivka says my map is upside down, but she’s just mad because I drew her bedroom as “NO ENTRY: SISTER ZONE.”

#### Tuesday

Emergency! A teacher came down the street. Mommy whispered, “Code Red!” and shoved me and Yankel into the closet. I landed on a shoe. It smelled like herring.

We listened at the door. The teacher asked, “Any school-aged children here?” Mommy said, “Just my daughter.” I held my breath for so long I nearly passed out. Unfairness: 15 out of 10.

#### Wednesday

Tatty says it’s time for a new plan. If they discover me, I’ll have to go to school. But not the local one—he’ll find the farthest school possible, where the teachers don’t know a mezuzah from a potato.

I asked if I could wear a fake mustache to blend in. He said, “We’ll buy you a new hat instead.” Not the same, Tatty.

---

#### Thursday

Today I practiced the “tzitzis swap.” You have to get your tzitzis off and your “pioneer tie” on in the bathroom, fast, before anyone notices. If you mess up, everyone sees your tzitzis and you’re BUSTED.

Challenge: try to swap tzitzis and tie in under 30 seconds. My record: 46 seconds. I need to work on my technique.

---

#### Friday

Tatty says if I ever get caught with my tzitzis, just say it’s a “lucky scarf.” I’m thinking of inventing the “invisible tzitzis.” Still working on that.

Shabbos is coming. That means no school, no hiding, just chulent and singing. Unfairness: 0 out of 10 (for one day only).

---

#### Sunday

Biggest twist yet: Tatty says if I can’t stay hidden, he’ll try to “lose my paperwork” between two schools so nobody knows where I’m supposed to be. Is it possible to become invisible on paper? I’m going to practice my disappearing act in the living room just in case.

---

#### Monday

It’s been three days and nobody’s come looking for me. Tatty says I’m officially “off the grid.” I think that means I win. Or maybe it means I get extra homework.

Rivka says if I ever get famous, I should write a book called “How to Survive Communist School Without Going.” Maybe I will.

Unfairness ranking: 5 out of 10. But bragging rights: 100 out of 10. Hillel, Chassidishe Spy, signing off.
