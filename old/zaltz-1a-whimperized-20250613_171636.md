Hillel’s Secret Diary: Mission—Keep Shabbos Free

Sunday, October 5th  
Mission Briefing: Tatty and Mommy just told me I have to go to public school… except on Shabbos. (Unfairness rating: 100/10.) The principal threatened to send me to an orphanage if I don’t show up every day—including Saturdays. So our new top-secret goal is: Don’t go to school on Shabbos, but survive the rest of the week.

Monday, October 6th  
Step 1—Choose the perfect school. Tatty marched me to a school in a non-Jewish neighborhood, hoping nobody notices me missing on Shabbos. We picked a second-grade class (even though I’m almost ten) so I’d get fewer teachers to bribe. Genius, right? Unfairness rating for being “skipped” a grade: 8/10. I feel like a baby among tiny kids, but at least they won’t question my two-day-week “illness.”

Tuesday, October 7th  
Step 2—Activate Operation Gift-Bribe. Tatty handed my new teacher a box of fancy teas and said, “Hillel can’t come on Saturdays. He’s weak.” The teacher swallowed her “Why?” face and nodded. Victory! Then she scheduled music class for Friday afternoon—perfect timing to avoid any school on Shabbos eve. (Except I hate their Soviet songs, but that’s Step 3’s problem.)

Wednesday, October 8th  
Step 3—Survive Music Class. I accidentally blurted, “I don’t like your songs!” (I meant “all your Soviet stuff,” but my brain short-circuited.) The teacher glared…until Pinchas the landlord’s son burst in singing Azerbaijani tunes. I hopped up and sang one too. The teacher forgot all about my insult because I sounded like a superstar. Disaster averted. Unfairness rating of getting tricked into patriot songs: 9/10 turned to 1/10 thanks to Plan B.

Thursday, October 9th  
Step 4—Tzitzis vs. Red Rag. Today was Pioneer registration—everyone got a red tie. But I can’t be seen wearing a tie or tzitzis at school! Solution: Bathroom disguises. Morning: slip on the red rag and hide tzitzis in my briefcase. Afternoon: ditch the tie, yank out tzitzis, and—bam—Jewish warrior returns. Feels like a spy trick, except with a yarmulke.

Friday, October 10th—Erev Shabbos  
Step 5—Summons to the Office! The principal called me in and snarled, “Why do you skip Saturdays?” I kept my “weak child” act (my ribs still hurt from jumping for the Azerbaijani tune). He yelled about “fanaticism” and “another day off,” and Tatty got a second summons. Then Tatty pulled out Operation Paper-Shuffle: He took my school file, told the principal he’d transfer me, and promised to handle the paperwork. Principal said “Fine!” and now nobody knows where I belong. (My school’s responsibility: zero. My Shabbos victory: 50%.)

Saturday, October 11th—Shabbos  
Mission Accomplished (so far)! I woke up in my own bed, ate Shabbos breakfast, and even davened twice. No pencils, no threats, no principals. Also—secret silver lining—I’m fast becoming a hiding champion. Mommy says, “Next week we’ll finalize your permanent assignment.” I hope that means staying home every Shabbos forever.

Sunday, October 12th  
Status Report: Our Paper-Shuffle didn’t work long—my old school sent messages; the new school got suspicious. Tatty sighed and said, “Plan C is coming.” I suggested we dig a tunnel from our courtyard to the shul. He laughed but said “Maybe when you’re older.” Unfair again! Still, I’m proud I kept Shabbos intact. My Shabbos-free streak: 2 weeks and counting.

Monday, October 13th  
Phase 2 Kickoff—Find a Real Solution. Tatty says he’ll register me in a Jewish-staffed school close by. Then he’ll bribe just one teacher, and I’ll remain “weak” only on Shabbos. That sounds fancy, except it means more walking—an hour each way. I’m already sore from Friday’s dash to hide the tzitzis. But if I get to skip every Shabbos, I’ll do it. Unfairness vs. Freedom ratio: totally worth it.

Mission Update: I’ve turned hiding into an art form, uncovered dozens of escape routes, and I still haven’t had to write a single word on Shabbos. My final mission score? 11 out of 10. Now, if only I could actually ride my bike in the courtyard…
