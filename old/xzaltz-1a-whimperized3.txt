# Hillel's Secret Diary

## Saturday, September 5th

Today was all about hiding even more. Dad said we need to make sure no one knows we’re still hiding. It's like an undercover mission, but way less cool and way more stressful.

Mommy came up with a new hiding spot for me when I’m not at school. It’s in the bathroom! I have to hide my tzitzis there so the teachers don’t see them. I tried to be sneaky, but every time I peek out, I almost bump into Dad’s foot. Ouch! My elbow still hurts from last time.

Unfairness rating: 12 out of 10. It’s worse than having to wear two jackets in the winter!

## Sunday, September 6th

Dad introduced a new code to keep our secrets safe. We have to remember the special knock:
- Knock knock
- Wait (count to 3)
- Knock knock knock
- Wait (count to 3)
- Knock knock

I practiced it so many times I think my fingers are getting sore. It’s definitely a 5 out of 5 in memorization skills, but a 0 out of 5 in fun.

I also tried to come up with a better hiding spot. My idea? Building a secret tunnel from our house to the shul! I drew a map with crayons (they’re thicker so they don’t show up easily). Mom said it’s a smart idea but “maybe when you’re older.” Guess I’ll keep dreaming.

Silver lining: Drawing the map was kinda fun. At least I’m good at art!

## Monday, September 7th

Guess what? Ms. Nina called Dad to talk about my absences again. It’s like she has a sixth sense for figuring out when I’m not there. Dad handled it like a pro, but I was ready with my excuse about being "weak and needing rest." Totally not convincing to me.

Unfairness rating: 14 out of 10. Being called "weak" is worse than getting no dessert!

During recess, I saw some kids playing soccer again. I wanted to join, but I stayed hidden behind the curtains. Sometimes I think about kicking the ball over, but then I remember the guard chasing me last time. Maybe one day...

## Tuesday, September 8th

Today was a rollercoaster! During music class, I almost messaged everyone about my secret cheder, but then Ms. Nina asked why I never sing. Panic mode activated!

Instead of staying silent, I decided to sing one of Pinchas’s favorite songs. It was scary, but Ms. Nina actually liked it and forgot about my silence. Score!

Unfairness rating: 10 out of 10. It’s like getting a free pass in recess but way more meaningful.

Silver lining: Maybe singing isn’t so bad after all. At least I got out of trouble and entertained Ms. Nina.

## Wednesday, September 9th

Reb Bentcha Maroz came to our secret cheder in the cellar today. He told us stories about sacrifice and being strong. I felt like a mini hero listening to him. Maybe hiding isn’t so bad if we have awesome teachers.

But then, we had to quickly hide when a guard came by. I tripped over a box and made a loud noise. Mom rushed us back just in time, but my knee is scraped. Ouch!

Unfairness rating: 15 out of 10. Tripping over boxes is worse than losing my favorite candy.

Silver lining: Reb Bentcha’s stories make me feel brave, even when I trip.

## Thursday, September 10th

Today was all about staying clean and keeping my tzitzis hidden. I practiced taking them off and putting them back without anyone noticing. It’s like a magic trick, but less impressive.

Mommy reminded me that every time we play outside, we have to be super careful. I almost forgot and left my shoes outside. Yankel had to bring them back in quickly. Now I have to keep them inside when I’m not wearing them. Major buzzkill.

Unfairness rating: 13 out of 10. Losing a shoe is worse than getting a bad haircut!

## Friday, September 11th - Erev Shabbos

Getting ready for Shabbos is the hardest part of the week. We have to make everything perfect so no one suspects anything. Today, Dad told me we need to be even more careful because they’re tightening the net. What does that even mean? Sounds like they’re fishing for kids with actual nets!

I came up with a brilliant plan to disguise our hidings spots with bigger decorations. Mom said it’s a good idea but “let’s see how it works first.” Fingers crossed!

Unfairness rating: 16 out of 10. It’s worse than missing the last piece of my favorite candy!

Silver lining: Designing the new decorations was fun. Maybe I’m a secret interior designer!

## Saturday, September 12th - Motzei Shabbos

After havdalah, Dad announced that Reb Mendel is coming to teach us. But here are the rules:
1. He uses the special knock
2. We can NEVER tell ANYONE
3. Not even other Jewish kids
4. Not even if they bribe us with candy
5. Not even if they offer me my favorite lollipop

I don’t have any best friends because I CAN’T LEAVE THE HOUSE. This is the WORST.

I also tried to hide my diary, but it rolled out from behind my books. Mom found it and gave me a stern look. I quickly shoved it under my pillow. Trust me, I’m good at hiding secrets… most of the time.

Unfairness rating: 17 out of 10. Hiding a diary is worse than forgetting your homework!

## Sunday, September 13th

Bad news today. Dad heard that the Friedman kids got caught and had to leave to live with relatives in another city. Their parents said, “Bye kids, go live somewhere else now!” I don’t want that to happen to us.

Mommy hugged me extra tight tonight. I think she’s worried too. But at least her hugs don’t smell like pickles unlike Tante Miriam’s, who might nick my cheeks if I have to go.

Unfairness rating: 18 out of 10. Being forced to live with Tante Miriam is worse than stepping on a Lego.

Silver lining: At least our family stays together, even if it means hiding like crazy.

## Monday, September 14th

Our melamed, Reb Mendel, came today! His beard is so long I bet he could trip on it. (I didn't say that out loud though.)

He whispered THE ENTIRE TIME. Like, we’re inside our own house! I whispered back, “Why are we whispering?”

He said, “The walls have ears in Samarkand.”

WHAT?! I spent the next ten minutes staring at the walls looking for ears. I didn’t see any.

Yankel laughed so hard he snorted. “It means people might be listening, dummy!”

Oh. That makes more sense. But also, rude, Yankel.

The cool part though? Learning in whispers makes everything feel like a secret mission. We’re like Torah spies or something. That’s actually pretty awesome. Maybe hiding isn’t all bad if we get to feel like superheroes.

Unfairness rating: 19 out of 10. Learning in whispers is worse than doing extra chores!

## Tuesday, September 15th

First day of school! Not for me though. Obviously.

Rivka had to go and she looked like she was going to her own execution. Dad gave her a hug and whispered something. Probably, “Remember everything they say about Hashem is total nonsense.”

I watched all the kids walking by with their backpacks and lunch boxes. One kid dropped his apple and it rolled into the street. He just picked it up and kept eating it! GROSS! But also... at least he CAN eat his apple in the street. Unlike SOME people who are stuck inside.

I’m not bitter. OK, maybe a little bitter. It’s like being stuck without dessert. Not fun at all.

Unfairness rating: 20 out of 10. Missing out on playing outside is worse than losing your favorite candy!

Silver lining: At least I don’t have to share my apple. Yum!

## Wednesday, September 16th

Mommy told us the story of how we came to Samarkand today. Apparently, when I was 3, we had to run away from Nazis.

She said I was SO hungry and this non-Jewish neighbor tried to give me food but it wasn't kosher. And I cried and cried but Mommy didn’t let me eat it.

“Even as a baby, you kept kosher!” she said all proud.

Great. So I’ve been suffering for food my WHOLE LIFE. This explains so much.

Unfairness rating: 21 out of 10. Being told no to food is worse than stepping on a bug!

Silver lining: Knowing this makes me appreciate my parents' strength even more. They’re like real-life heroes!

## Thursday, September 17th

TODAY WAS INSANE.

A teacher came to our door! And she did NOT know the special knock!

Mommy grabbed me and Yankel and basically THREW us into the back room. I crashed into Yankel and we both fell over. My elbow still hurts.

We could hear everything:
Teacher: “Hello, I’m from the school. Do you have any children?”
Mommy: “Just my daughter.”
Teacher: “No boys?”
Mommy: “No.”

Yankel put his hand over my mouth, which was gross because his hands smelled like herring. I couldn’t even complain because then the teacher would hear me!

Finally she left. We stayed hidden for another MILLION YEARS (OK, ten minutes) just to be safe.

My heart was beating so fast I thought it might explode. Is this what being a spy feels like? Because I don’t like it.

Unfairness rating: 22 out of 10. Being almost caught is worse than forgetting to brush your teeth!

Silver lining: Now I know how to hide even better. Ninja skills: unlocked!

## Friday, September 18th - Erev Shabbos

Tatty came home early and he looked more tired than that time I made him play horsey for an hour straight.

He said MORE families are having to send their kids away. It’s getting worse.

“Will we have to leave?” I asked.

“Im yirtzeh Hashem, no,” he said.

Then he said we need to be EVEN MORE CAREFUL.

More careful?! What’s next, are we going to have to turn invisible? Because that would actually be cool. But also impossible. I checked.

Actually, I have a new plan. What if we dig a tunnel from our house to the shul? Then we could go places underground like moles! I drew a map and everything. Tatty said, “Maybe when you’re older.” That’s adult code for “never.”

Later I heard Tatty tell Mommy something about “the net is tightening.” Are they fishing for kids now? With actual nets? That’s terrifying but also kind of silly. How big would the net need to be?

Unfairness rating: 23 out of 10. More carefulness is worse than a double chore assignment!

Silver lining: Drawing the tunnel map was awesome. My imagination is super strong!

## Saturday, September 19th - Motzei Shabbos

Reb Bentcha came to our secret cheder today and told us about courage and sacrifice. He’s like a real-life Yoda with a beard.

He also shared a story about soldiers making a human bridge to cross a river. It was intense! But it made me feel like we’re doing something important, even if it’s hiding and being quiet.

After the lesson, we played a secret game of hide and seek in the cellar. Yankel almost got caught when he tripped over a box again. I laughed but then felt bad because my knee still hurts.

Unfairness rating: 24 out of 10. Playing games in a scary cellar is worse than running in the rain without shoes!

Silver lining: Reb Bentcha’s stories make me feel like a brave hero. Plus, hide and seek is kinda fun if you don’t get caught.

THE END (of this notebook)

P.S. – Mommy got me a new notebook but I have to hide this one first. I’m thinking under the mattress? No, too obvious. Behind the books? Maybe. Being a professional hider is harder than Yankel makes it look.
