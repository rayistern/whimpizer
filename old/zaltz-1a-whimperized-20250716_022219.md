# Hillel’s Secret Diary: Chapter One – Living Under Communism  

## Monday, Day 1: The Big, Scary Backstory  
Hi, I’m Hillel, almost nine, and this is my SECRET diary. If anyone finds it—especially the K.G.B.—I’m in huge trouble!

So here’s what my parents told me last night by candlelight (because electricity could be turned off any minute):  
1. After 1917, **Communists** decided religion was “poison.”  
2. They shut down shuls, shot or exiled anyone who resisted, even little kids.  
3. A scary group called **Yevsektzia** (“the three letters,” GPU/NKVD/KGB) made life super hard for Yidden.  
4. If your parents taught you Torah at home, YOU could be sent to a “re-education” home.  

Unfairness rating: **100 out of 10.** Worse than running out of candy on Shabbos.

## Tuesday, Day 2: Meeting Mr. Daniel, the Yiddishist Spy  
Today Mr. Daniel Borisovitch came over. He’s a rare kind of Jew who loves Yiddish (everybody calls him a Yiddishist), but he once worked for the Yevsektzia.  

During tea (which smelled like cinnamon and worry), he whispered:  
> “We tricked parents into government schools—’pick your teachers in Yiddish,’ we said. Then we quietly swapped them for our own.”  

He told how the worst part was forcing kids to eat treif or even bread on Pesach. The children pressed their lips shut like locked treasure chests. He said,  
> “Those little ones were real heroes.”  

Now Daniel has a heavy heart—and we have a bigger secret to keep.

Unfairness rating: **99 / 10** (just one point less because at least we got free Yiddish lessons).

## Wednesday, Day 3: Operation “Hide in Plain Sight”  
I’m basically house-arrested. If the neighbors see me during “school hours,” they’ll rat me out. My sister Rivka goes to public school (to throw them off our scent), but me and Yankel (my 12-year-old “professional hider” big brother) must stay inside.

Mommy posted a schedule on the wall:  
- **8 AM–2 PM:** Hide from teachers  
- **2 PM–4 PM:** Secret Torah learning  

I tried to peek outside once and got a stern look from Mommy. I’ll never forget it.  

Scheme attempt: I drew a pretend mustache and giant coat to look like a short adult. Mommy said NO. Adults have no vision!

## Thursday, Day 4: The Secret Knock Code  
Guess what? We have our own spy code for slamming the doorbell so only Jewish kids know it’s safe to open:

1. Knock knock  
2. **Pause** (count to three inside your head)  
3. Knock knock knock  
4. **Pause**  
5. Knock knock  

One slip-up and everyone panics. Today the mailman tried his own knock and I almost answered holding a half-eaten chocolate bar. Fuzzy chocolate on the floor = DOUBLE trouble.

## Friday, Day 5: First Underground Cheder  
Tonight, by flashlight (candles are risky), our living room turned into CHEDER. First melamed Reb Zushedershamash (everyone calls him “R. Zushe”) came. He’s tough but kind, with a white beard that tickles when he leans in to correct my alef-beis.  

We learned Yiddish alef-beis and Avos stories. Every letter looked like a little puzzle under candle glow. I felt like a Torah ninja.  

Silver lining: I’m officially a “hiding champion.” I stayed perfectly still for 30 minutes. Gold star, Hillel!

---

## Motzei Shabbos, Day 6: Silver Linings & Tiny Victories  
After Havdalah, Tatty told us about **secret yeshivos** in other homes. He even whispered he’s proud we’re fighting to be Jewish.  

Misheard moment: I thought Tatty said “the walls are spying.” I spent 10 minutes staring at our kitchen walls. No spy ears yet.

Ranking this Erev Shabbos: **47 / 10** (but +1 for secret cheder excitement).

---

## Sunday, Day 7: Faux Pas in Music Class (Almost)  
My father finally had to register me in public school—only Saturdays I’m “too sick” to go. Today, Ms. Nina asked me in choir,  
> “Zaltzman, why don’t you sing?”  

I blurted, “I don’t like *your* songs!”  
Cue panic. She demanded,  
> “Sing *your* song!”  

I ran home, grabbed our landlord’s son Pinchas’s Azerbaijani record, and belted out a tune. She LOVED it, so she forgot all about “my” songs. Crisis averted.  

Unfairness scale: Public school forced me into tiny lies. **8 / 10** (still better than no music at all).

---

## Monday, Day 8: Caught with Tzitzis Drama  
I tried sneaking tzitzis into school under my shirt. Nurse came for shots and spotted the fringes. She whispered,  
> “Achachamtchik—little rabbi!”  

I nearly melted into the floor. Now I do a quick bathroom change: red Pioneers tie in, tzitzis out, then tzitzis back on at home. My arms get a little scratchy, but I look like everyone else. Spy-kid level: EXPERT.

---

## Tuesday, Day 9: A Summons to the Principal’s Office  
Biggest scare yet: I got called to the Principal—the whole “rest two days a week” trick was discovered. They yelled,  
> “No more Saturdays off!”  

They threatened to send me to a Soviet orphanage. Daddy begged me to just go for one Shabbos. I ran away to my friend Michoel’s house instead and missed school again.  

Daddy’s face turned as white as our challah. We’re now plotting a big transfer to a far-away school where nobody asks questions.  

Plot twist: I’ll walk an hour each way in rain or snow—but at least I keep Shabbos. Hero status: UNLOCKED.

## Wednesday, Day 10: One Jew Against Eight Million Soldiers  
In cheder, R. Bentcha told us about Yidden who got persecuted by the NKVD. One guy put on tefillin in front of **eight million** armed soldiers. Rebel score: **1** Jew vs. **8,000,000** soldiers. That’s some serious hero math.  

Afterwards, we looked around at our crumb-covered table and thought, “If *we* are the next in line… yikes.”  

Lesson learned: Even one tiny Jewish kid can out-brave a million bullies.

---

## Thursday, Day 11: Miracle Escape from a Guard  
Today at cheder, an escaped prisoner was on the loose and REAL soldiers ran with rifles. I walked home “slowly” (they told me) but a guard chased me shouting. I sprinted, heart pounding like a drum, and hid behind a market stall until he passed.  

My lungs still hurt. Paranoid rating: **10 / 10**.

---

## Friday, Day 12: Underground Cellar Hideout  
R. Bentcha found us a new cheder in the old stable cellar—garbage, dust, manure and all. Two barred windows let in sun and spy warnings. The escape window makes our hands bleed from rusty nails, but CHEDER in a bunker? Totally badass.  

Secret mission mood: **Cruisin’**.

---

## Motzei Shabbos, Day 13: A Teacher of Sacrifice  
R. Bentcha once cut his own fingers so he’d be unfit for the army. He told us that it’s better to be “crooked for G-d” than to learn Communist marching drills.  

He slapped our hands with his gartel (soft belt) when we misbehaved. I realized real sacrifice isn’t about running away—it’s about staying strong in what you believe, even if you have to bleed a little on rusty nails.

---

## Sunday, Day 14: When the Elders Played Soccer  
One day we were playing soccer in the courtyard when R. Bentcha walked in looking horrified. He told us he saw three holy elders—R. Eliyahu, R. Boruch, R. Yerachmiel—playing soccer too, and joked,  
> “If they can’t do it, why are you running around?”  

Unfairness? **0 / 10**—today was a real laugh.

---

## Monday, Day 15: An Education Engraved Forever  
Daddy always says:  
> “Reading, writing, arithmetic you can learn at home. The rest comes from Talmud and Chassidus.”  

He called tradesmen to build a sign factory so we’d have a real income. I guess being a factory apprentice beats being a Communist engineer—at least I keep Shabbos!

---

## Tuesday, Day 16: A Bar Mitzvah Secret  
Last night I turned 13 in our living room—no party hall, just eight brave Yidden, a borrowed siddur Torah Ohr, and whispered “Mazel tov.” They paid three hundred rubles for that book! My aunt used to say,  
> “Three hundred rubles? I’d expect pictures!”  

I’ll treasure that siddur forever.

### My Big Takeaways  
1. **Every day** can feel like a spy mission.  
2. **One small Jew** can out-stand millions of soldiers.  
3. **Cheder Bunkers** are way cooler than playgrounds.  
4. **Unfairness** has to be rated (my average so far: **25 / 10**).  
5. **Keeping Torah** is worth all the mustaches, camouflage, and bruised elbows.

THE END (of this notebook—until someone finds it!)
