Hillel’s Secret Diary: My Year of School Survival  
(Adapted “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” style)

Unfairness Level: 50 out of 10  

Today was my first day “officially” enrolled in public school. I didn’t want to go—Tatty and Mommy chose it so I could stay home on Shabbos without arousing suspicion. But walking past all those kids wearing red Pioneers’ ties (the “red rags”) felt like entering enemy territory.  

Rules of Engagement:  
1. Go to school Tuesday–Friday.  
2. Be sick (weak child!) every Monday & Saturday.  
3. Never let them see my tzitzis or hear me daven.  

I showed up clutching my briefcase and a fake cough. The teacher, Ms. Semyanova, didn’t question it once—score one for Team Hillel!

Music class. Big mistake. They forced us to belt out Soviet songs about Stalin and “Father Russia.” My heart sank when Ms. Semyanova pointed at me: “Zaltzman, sing!”  

Without thinking, I blurted, “I don’t like your songs.” Instantly, my stomach did flips. That’s when Pinchas the landlord’s kid saved me—he blasts Azerbaijani pop records at home, so I serenaded the class with “Love in Baku” instead. The teacher was so wowed she forgot my faux pas. Crisis averted… barely.

Tzitzis trouble. I wore them under my shirt, but the school nurse might jab me with a vaccine today.  

Solution? Bathroom Switcheroo:  
– Before class: Put on Pioneer tie, hide tzitzis in briefcase.  
– After school: Reverse in bathroom stall.  

I swear hiding fringes is harder than hide-and-seek with a sleep-deprived Yakov.

Code Red: Principal’s Office summons. I nearly fainted.  

Apparently “resting for health reasons” didn’t fly anymore. They demanded I come next Saturday—despite my “weak child” excuse. Tatty tried to bribe them with more doctor’s notes, but they threatened to send me off to a state orphanage if I skipped again.  

Tatty’s pep talk:  
“You can skip one Saturday… but then you must go.”  

Me: “Then I’ll hide at Michoel’s house until late. Problem solved.”  

Tatty muttered “bris” under his breath. (That’s adult code for “Oh no.”)

Friday, September 11th—Erev Shabbos  
Unfairness Level: 83 out of 10  

I did it. I snuck out at dawn and crashed at Michoel’s. By the time I snuck home, I’d missed school and avoided the principal. Small victory!  

Silver Lining: I’m practically a ninja.

Secret Mission: Underground Cheder  

With school off-limits, I meet Reb Bentcha in the Mishulovins’ basement—aka “the Cellar of Doom.” It’s dusty, stinky, and the floors are swarming with… maybe manure? But it’s perfect for secret Torah classes.  

Advantages of the Cellar:  
– Totally off the radar  
– Two barred windows let in light (and spy-proof escape routes)  
– It’s actually cool when the sun is blazing  

Learning Torah there makes me feel like a real spy. Mission code name: Operation Alef-Beis.

BEST DAY EVER: Reb Bentcha told a story about elder Chassidim playing soccer—R. Eliyahu got a ball to the head! He drew our attention to how silly it is for “holy people” to goof off, then glared at us. We giggled, got caught, but he forgave us because the lesson was on point.  

Also, I got to practice my “knock code” 2-3-2 for when melamed visits—like top-secret door signals. I’m officially a hiding champion: yesterday I stayed behind that curtain for a full hour without blinking.

Back to public school tomorrow. I still hate their “nothing exists” classes, but at least I have:  
– My tired “weak child” routine  
– Emergency bathroom tzitzis swaps  
– A secret basement cheder  
– And the thrill of being a Torah spy  

Final Assessment: This school-year challenge is worse than cold cholent and smaller challah rolls combined—but I’m getting really good at the hiding game. And who knows? Maybe one day I’ll tell all the kids at yeshiva about my epic double-life adventures.  

Stay tuned for “The Great Principal Showdown” and “The Day I Almost Blew My Cover in Gym Class.”

P.S. New notebook is hidden behind Mommy’s siddur. Don’t tell anyone.
