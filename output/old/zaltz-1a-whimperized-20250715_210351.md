# Hillel’s Secret Diary: Chapter 1 (Wimpy Kid Edition)

## Sunday, October 1st  
My name is Hillel, I’m 8, and my life in Samarkand is waaaay weirder than anyone else’s. Today I found out the Soviet government wants every kid in their schools—where they teach there’s no Hashem. So my family is on permanent lockdown. I can’t even wave at the neighbor’s cat. Unfairness level: 100/10.

## Monday, October 2nd – The Special Knock Code  
Tatty taught me our secret code so the neighbors and nosy teachers don’t learn there are hidden kids here. It goes:
“Knock-knock…pause…knock-knock-knock…pause…knock-knock.”  
Mess it up, and you get a household full of panicked adults diving behind sofas. Fun times.

## Tuesday, October 3rd – Daniel’s Sad Tea Party  
Mr. Daniel showed up for tea and told us he used to help the government trick Jewish parents. Now he feels terrible because kids refused treif food at school—tiny champions pressing their lips shut tight. He said, “Those children were heroes,” and his eyes filled up. Meanwhile I drank my tea, thought “Great. My life is boring compared to that,” and got teary over missing recess. Hero envy: 9/10.

## Wednesday, October 4th – Teacher Hunt Day  
I spied teachers with clipboards walking block to block: registration time! They ask neighbors, “Any unregistered kids here?” I watched them ask Mrs. Goldberg. My heart pounded so hard I thought she could hear it. She shrugged “Nope,” and I almost fainted from relief. Note to self: practice holding breath.

## Thursday, October 5th – Secret Cheder #1  
Living room → secret cheder. Tatty pulled the curtains, Mommy dimmed the lamp, and we learned alef-beis and Avos stories in whispers. Even the couch felt conspiratorial. Rivka scrawled letters while I practiced “I am a hiding ninja.” Silver lining: I’m really good at hiding behind pillows now.

## Friday, October 6th – Erev Shabbos Logistics  
Getting ready for Shabbos is like planning a top-secret mission. We had to cook in stealth mode and hide the flour before 3 PM. Mommy quizzed us on the parsha, but all I could think about was riding my bike. Bike riding → forbidden mission. Sad.

## Motzei Shabbos, October 7th – Secret Melamed Arrives  
Reb Mendel came—long beard, whisper voice. He taught Alef-beis songs so quiet you’d think we’re ninjas reading Torah. Whispering is cool: we’re “Torah spies”! First silver lining of the week: I’m a spy.

## Sunday, October 8th – Squeaky Apple Disaster  
Mailman knocked normally. I panicked, dropped my apple, and it rolled under the couch. Hours later it’s fuzzy. Apple ransom: 1 missing apple = 1 lifetime regret.

## Monday, October 9th – Friedman Family Fallout  
Heard the Friedmans got caught not in school, and the boys were shipped off to cousins far away. I LOVE my cousins, but NOT like that. I’d rather eat broccoli than live anywhere but here. Unfairness: 11/10.

## Tuesday, October 10th – Music Class Fiasco  
In music class they made us sing about Lenin and Stalin. I blurted, “I don’t like your songs!” Teacher demanded I sing *my* song. I froze…then remembered Pinchas’s Azerbaijani records. Sang a totally random tune—teacher loved it! Victory dance: 1/1.

## Wednesday, October 11th – Caught with Tzitzis  
Monday I showed up after Shabbos and everyone laughed: “Where were you?” I pretended I was the school ghost. Then nurse came for shots and I tried hiding my tzitzis under my shirt—fail! She winked, “You’re a good boy, little rabbi.” I felt famous but also terrified. Hide-and-seek with clothes: 10/10 stressful.

## Thursday, October 12th – Summons to the Principal  
Got called to the big office. Principal, assistant principal, teacher—all staring. “Why absent Saturdays?” I said the doctor made me rest two days. They screamed “Saturday is not a rest day!” They threatened tatty. Tatty threatened THEM: “He’s weak!” They threatened to take me away if I missed Shabbos again. Mega panic. Escape plan #42: bunk bed tunnel.

## Friday, October 13th – Operation: Go to Michoel’s  
Next Shabbos, I sneaked out at dawn and hid at Michoel’s. Tatty wasn’t thrilled but said better that than orphanage. I felt like a spy courier delivering secret dessert. Spy snack: 🥐

## Sunday, October 15th – New School Adventure  
Tatty enrolled me in a school an hour’s walk away, in a non-Jewish area, so they won’t notice Shabbos absences. I drew a map, packed emergency candy, and practiced a disguise—fake freckles. Actual disguise result: I looked like a polka-dot potato.

## Monday, October 16th – Melamed Whispers, I Listen  
Ms. Fidasya lets me stay home Saturdays for “health reasons.” Win! But five miles of walking in winter, pitch-black streets…mega stress. I pretend I have night vision goggles. Silver lining: I’m getting ripped legs from all the walking.

## Tuesday, October 17th – Real Cheder Underground  
Reb Zushe’s cheder moved to the dusty, manure-smelling cellar. We scratched ourselves climbing through bars, but the draft kept us cool. I actually like the spooky vibe. It’s like Hogwarts, but with kosher snacks instead of Bertie Bott’s Beans.

## Wednesday, October 18th – Bread & Butter Boost  
Reb Zushe brings dabs of butter on bread—magic fuel for starving cheder kids. It tastes like miracle jam. I gobbled mine so fast I got a bellyache. Worth it.

## Thursday, October 19th – Reb Bentcha’s Mega Stories  
Bentcha Maroz taught us about soldiers drowning to build a human bridge so others could conquer the city. He said those heroes are real tzaddikim. My brain: “Human bridge? Gross but heroic!”  Unfairness rank: 1/10 (I’d trade my leg cramps to be that brave).

## Friday, October 20th – Soccer Shame Lesson  
We were playing soccer in the yard when Bentcha caught us. He told us fancy elder Chassidim once did it, but then the ball hit their heads. Moral: if grown-ups don’t do it, neither should we. Lesson over. Soccer ban: confirmed.

## Motzei Shabbos, October 21st – Deuteronomy Drama  
Bentcha caught a kid bragging about public school. He quizzed him on “Follow Hashem…fear Him…worship Him…cleave to Him.” Then explained “fear Him = don’t go communist school,” etc., with cheers and table-knocks. Kid learned humility—or got too scared to brag again.

## Sunday, October 22nd – Forced to Think Big  
Mommy said other parents want secular degrees. But Tatty says “Better to be a simple scribe than a lost engineer.” He’s like “engineers build machines; tzaddikim build souls.” My take: I’ll stick with hiding ninja for now.

## Monday, October 23rd – Bar-Mitzvah Surprise  
I’m turning 13 soon! No one thought about a Bar-Mitzvah party in Stalin’s year of terror. Then eight brave relatives came over quietly. Aunt Rosa wanted winter coat, I wanted a real Torah Ohr siddur. I won. Reunion: priceless. Aunt Rosa: shocked I paid 300 rubles for a book.

**That’s it for Chapter 1!** My life is one big top-secret mission. Every day is a new disaster-adventure. But hey, I’m getting really good at hiding, whispering, and eating fuzzy apples. Tomorrow: another day, another code to remember, another unfairness to rate. Wish me luck!
