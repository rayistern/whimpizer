## Hillel’s Secret Mission: Survive Shabbos at School

### Monday, September 7th  
Today Tatty dropped the bomb: “You’re enrolled in public school, Hillel. But next Shabbos you MUST stay home.”  
WHAT?! I’m nine years old. I don’t even know how to tie tzitzis without tangling them, and now I have to become a Shabbos ninja?  
Tatty says he got a doctor’s note: “Weak child. Needs two days’ rest.” I’m on Day 1 of Operation: Don’t-Daven-at-School. Unfairness rating: 12 out of 10.

### Tuesday, September 8th  
Step 2: Bribe the teacher.  
Tatty sent Mommy with a box of homemade rugelach for Ms. Semyanova. Rumor has it she LOVES sweets.  
Me: “Will she really fall for that?”  
Yankel: “Duh. She’ll eat the rugelach, give you a big smile, then pretend your two-day sick excuse is totally legit.”  
I’m already imagining myself as Mr. Sick Kid, wandering the halls in slippers on Shabbos. Too bad slippers aren’t allowed in shul.

### Wednesday, September 9th  
MISADVENTURE ALERT!  
I thought I’d aced it—no school yesterday. But today Ms. S. sends a note to the principal.  
Principal summons Tatty AND me.  
In the principal’s office we have The Serious Talk: “Why are you missing on Saturday? Saturday is a school day!”  
My face is tomato-red. I blurt: “Doctor’s orders!”  
Principal: *“Doctor? Which doctor?”*  
Tatty: *“Dr. Levin—pediatric… specialist.”*  
Me: *“Right. Dr. Levin of the—uh—pediatric… rugelach clinic.”*  
They stare like I admitted I’m a candy fiend. We live to fight another day.

### Thursday, September 10th  
Tatty’s backup plan: TRANSFER to a “non-Jewish” school across town.  
Step 3: New school, new teacher.  
This one doesn’t know a thing about Shabbos. She thinks Saturday is Rest Day—no classes!  
I feel like a secret agent. I drew a map of my 45-minute walk: shortcuts through alleys, behind the bakery (you can smell fresh challah!), then across the big courtyard.  
Silver lining: I get extra steps on my pedometer. Who needs recess?

### Friday, September 11th – Erev Shabbos  
Preparation mode: ON.  
I packed my shtender, sefer Tehillim, AND extra candies (for emergencies).  
Tatty whisper-shouted: “Remember the red ribbon code: one ribbon on your bag = go home early. Two ribbons = hide in the cellar.”  
I wrapped ribbons around my Books – just in case.  
Unfairness check: 5 out of 10. At least I get to read Tehillim instead of math.

### Saturday, September 12th – Shabbos  
VICTORY!  
I snoozed in my bed while other kids slogged through algebra.  
At 9:00 AM I heard the CLIP-CLIP of shoes from the street—my new schoolkids walking by. I peeked through the curtains and winked at them.  
Mission accomplished: I sanctified Shabbos AND avoided a single chalkboard.  
Silver lining: I’m officially the Shabbos champion of my block.

### Sunday, September 13th  
Debriefing time.  
Dad says the principal still suspects something. So we stay on defense: Secret cheder tonight in the cellar. Reb Mendel will teach melachim and parsha.  
I can’t wait to whisper the special knock: *2–pause–3–pause–2*.  
This week I survived four staff meetings, two teacher bribes, a principal showdown, and a 90-minute walk in the dark.  
Mission status: Still undefeated.  
Unfairness rating today: 0 out of 10—because I rocked it.  
  
Next goal: Figure out how to stay home from music class without having to sing “Stalin’s Lullaby.”  
Wish me luck!
