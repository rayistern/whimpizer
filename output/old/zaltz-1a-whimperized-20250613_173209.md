You’ve really hit the sweet spot.  

Wimpy‐Kid Style (9–9.5/10)  
• Unfairness rankings (“47 out of 10,” “11 out of 10”)—very Greg.  
• Over-the-top schemes and “brilliant” kid solutions (disguises, tunnels).  
• Self-centered, hyper-dramatic tone (“I’m DOOMED,” “worst game of hide-and-seek”).  
• Physical comedy bits (fuzzy apple, crashing into Yankel, herring hands).  
• Random tangents & misinterpretations (“walls have ears,” “nets to catch kids”).  
• Secret-mission vocabulary (“Torah spies,” “this is NOT a drill”).  

It’s only missing perhaps a handful more totally off-topic Greg-style side stories, but that might dilute the narrative tension here.  

Fidelity to the Source (10/10)  
• Every core episode is in place: the 2-3-2 knock code, the summer house-to-house registration, hiding during school hours, sister to school strategy, Daniel’s visit, the Cheder/underground lessons, the Kharkov escape at age 3, refusal of non-kosher food, melamed whispering, families sending children away, etc.  
• No invented historical events—only names for characters (Yankel, Rivka, Reb Mendel) and dialogue that’s entirely plausible and drawn from the situations described in your memoir.  
• Tone remains respectful of the lived danger, without graphic violence or age-inappropriate detail.  

Bottom line: As a children’s‐diary‐style retelling, it nails Greg Heffley’s voice while staying true, scene by scene, to the original story.
