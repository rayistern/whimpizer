Mission: Register for School Without Losing Shabbat  

Okay, here’s the deal: I’m nine, and starting today I’m officially a public school kid. Tatty bribed Ms. Semyanova with a “get-well” gift and got her to excuse me on Saturdays for my “sensitivity.” I swear, every kid wants to skip a grade—me, I just want to skip one day a week.  

Unfairness Rating: 10/10 (Worse than eating cold cholent for breakfast.)  

Steps so far:  
1) Show up Monday.  
2) Hand over fake doctor’s note.  
3) Nod a lot.  
4) Promise to rest on Saturdays.  

I’m in. Let the weirdness begin.

Code Name: Tzitzis Ninja  

We have two undercover outfits:  
• Red Rag (blech) for mornings  
• Tzitzis for afternoons  

At home: tie on red rag → sneak out → swap to tzitzis in bathroom → strut in like nothing’s wrong.  

Disaster almost struck today: Nurse announced surprise “back” injections. I panicked—tzitzis would show! So I yanked my shirt up, tucked them under, and said “Shoot away!” The nurse (a secret friend!) whispered, “Good boy, little rabbi.” Best. Speechless. Moment. Ever.  

Unfairness Rating: 7/10 (Better than missing doughnuts at recess.)

Shabbat Eve Panic  

Tatty and Mommy had a serious talk: “The net is tightening.” I thought they meant fishing nets. I spent half an hour imagining giant nets scooping us into Siberia. Then I realized “net” meant school registration. Duh.  

Plan for tomorrow:  
1) Hide briefcase under stairs.  
2) Eat leftover challah for lunch.  
3) Stay in hiding spot: under the dining table.  
4) Resist the urge to peek at the Goldberg kids flying kites outside.  

Unfairness Rating: 12/10 (Even worse than no candy on Yom Tov.)

Operation: Shabbat Fortress  

SUCCESS. I barely saw the sun. I ate five pieces of challah (Mommy said that’s my mitzvah). Yankel and I built a pillow barrier under the table so no one could see our feet. I tried to peek once—door made a creak, I froze, door stayed shut.  

Silver Lining: I’m now the undisputed hide-and-seek champion of Samarkand.  

Unfairness Rating: –3/10 (Shabbat is awesome, hiding not so awesome.)

Summons to Principal’s Office  

Guess what? They found out I wasn’t at school Saturday. Next thing you know: “Report at once!” I nearly wet my tzitzis. In the office were three scary grown-ups glaring.  

Me: “Doctor says I must rest.”  
Principal: “You must rest six days, not one!”  
I choked on my words, stuttered “I—I—I…”  
Tatty raced in, saved the day with more fake health talk.  

Mission Status: Survived, but heart will never quit racing.  

Unfairness Rating: 15/10 (Even losing the biggest piece of challah felt better.)

Operation: New School Escape  

Tatty found a school in a non-Jewish neighborhood—one hour’s walk away. WIN. No more threats, no more principal. Only problem: walking in snow-dark mornings like a zombie.  

I sketched wheels on my shoes. Mommy laughed. “Maybe next year.”  

Today I swapped schools, bowed to new teacher, and whispered the “rest” plan again. They bought it.  

Unfairness Rating: 8/10 (Better commute than Siberia, but worse than sliding on ice.)

Mission Accomplished  

Reported back to old school? Gone. New school? Never heard of me. No one cares if I skip Saturdays. I’m free!  

Achievement Unlocked: Stay home on Shabbat and still be “in school.”  

Final Unfairness Rating: 2/10 (Mostly because I still can’t ride my bike outside.)  

Conclusion: Best mission ever. I’m officially the Shabbat Survivor.
