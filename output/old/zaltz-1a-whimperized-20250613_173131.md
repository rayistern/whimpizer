Here’s a quick scorecard for your latest draft:

1. Wimpy-Kid Style (9–10/10)  
  • Voice and Tone – You’ve got the hyper-dramatic “unfairness” rankings, all-caps freak-outs, kid-logic tangents, physical comedy, schemes gone wrong and small silver linings (“Torah spies”!).  
  • Diary Structure – Dates, short punchy entries, casual asides, lists of rules.  
  • Self-Centered Lens – Hillel is endlessly focused on how it affects him, exactly like Greg Heffley.  

  Minimal room for extra Greg-isms (e.g. random mini-tangents about snacks or totally off-topic daydreams), but pushing it too far would risk drowning out the core story.  

2. Story Accuracy (10/10)  
  • All historical facts and secret-school mechanics are intact: the 2-3-2 knock code; hiding during school hours; sister in public school to protect the boys; Daniel’s guilt tale; fleeing Kharkov; refusal of non-kosher food; secret melamed; families sending kids away; etc.  
  • No invented plot points—every comedic episode is rooted in the source material’s events or conditions.  

In short: you’ve struck a terrific balance—full-blown Wimpy-Kid humor and kid-logic, with 100% fidelity to the Zaltzman narrative. Well done!
