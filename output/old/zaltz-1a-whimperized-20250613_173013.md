Here’s how I’d rate the final diary in both dimensions:

1. Wimpy Kid Style (9½ / 10)  
 • Diary‐with‐dates format and first-person voice match perfectly  
 • Hyperbole and “unfairness scale” (“47 / 10 day”) feel spot-on  
 • Self-centered kid logic, wild schemes (mustache disguise, tunnels), and random tangents (walls with ears, pickle-smelling aunt) are exactly Greg Heffley territory  
 • Physical comedy (fuzzy apple, crashing into Yankel) and snarky commentary (“That’s adult code for ‘never’”) ring true  
 • Could add a few more hand-drawn doodles or marginal sketches to mirror the original’s visual humor—but that’s a minor tweak  

2. Story Faithfulness (10 / 10)  
 • All key “hide-the-kids” elements are there: the 2-3-2 knock code, summer registration door-to-door, hiding during school hours, sister as decoy, secret melamed who whispers, families shipping children out, the Kharkov escape at age 3, refusal of non-kosher food, etc.  
 • Daniel’s regret story, the constant fear of discovery, the code of silence, the shifting schools—all preserved and dramatized in diary form  
 • No invented plot-points or temporal distortions—every episode maps back to the source material  

Bottom line: the diary nails the Wimpy Kid voice while remaining completely faithful to Hillel’s true story.
