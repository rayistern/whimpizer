Monday, September 7th  
Okay, so today was my very first “official” public-school Shabbos skip, and I survived without ending up in Siberia—or the principal’s office. That earns at least a 5 out of 10 on the Unfairness Scale (10 = watching your little sister ride her bike while you’re stuck inside).  

Here’s the plan Dad cooked up over cholent last night: he signed me up for Ms. Nina Semyanova’s class in the NON-Jewish neighborhood. Then he gave her a fancy pashkevil (I mean “teacher gift”) and told her I was a “weak child” who needed rest two days a week. Genius, right?  

So this morning I stayed home while everyone else trudged off. Shabbos was safe, AND I got an extra morning of breakfast cereal. Silver lining!

Wednesday, September 9th  
NOT a happy day. I got a summons to the principal’s office—Mommy’s face went SO white when Ms. Nina called.  

I marched in there, thinking maybe I was getting an award for “Best Sick Kid.” Instead, Principal Ivanov had his assistant and Ms. Nina staring me down like I’d spray-painted the school bus. He barked, “Zaltzman, why are you always absent on Saturday?”  

I stuck to the story: “Doctor said I’m weak.” They didn’t buy it. They threatened to revoke Dad’s parental rights and send me to “reeducation camp.” Basically a nightmare where they feed you dreidel-shaped pancakes for dinner.  

Unfairness rating: 11 out of 10. (Plus a bonus point for having my palms sweat through my pockets.)

Thursday, September 10th  
Dad’s next move: Operation “Send Hillel as Far as Humanly Possible.” My new school is on the other side of Samarkand—an H-hour walk every day.  

This morning I packed mittens, two apples, and my sense of dread. The walk through dark, lamp-free streets was like a horror movie, except instead of zombies it was me shivering and thinking, “I could be home watching zeidy’s beard grow.”  

Ms. Fidasya Archifovna (cute name, creepy stare) agreed to my “weak child” excuse. She actually patted my head in a “poor little guy” way. I’m pretty sure it was pity, not respect.  

Silver lining: I’m probably the toughest kid in class because I survived the Arctic Express route.

Monday, September 14th  
The new school started sniffing around: “Why aren’t you here on Shabbos?” I tried giving Ms. Fidasya a piece of baklava through the window, but she said it was a bribe. Rude!  

Dad went back to the first principal to “transfer my papers,” but he got distracted by a free seat and handed Dad the ENTIRE file folder back. He said, “You take care of it.” Then he waved goodbye.  

We waited. AND WAITED. Two weeks later… crickets. No school. No summons. No Ms. Fidasya.  

Victory! Turns out not being registered anywhere means I don’t HAVE to show up anywhere. Sneakiest loophole ever.

Friday, September 18th – Erev Shabbos  
I made it! No school on Shabbos, no more 50-minute walks, and no principal screaming about “fanaticism.” I’m officially a free agent.  

Unfairness Scale (reversed): this is a 0 out of 10 day—because I’m the only kid in Samarkand with ZERO homework tonight.  

Silver lining XXL: I get to light candles, learn parsha, AND gloat that I beat the system. Take THAT, public school!
